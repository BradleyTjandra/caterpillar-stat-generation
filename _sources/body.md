In D&D, character creation involves creating six numbers ("stats") which represent how good you are at six different areas. These six different stats become your "stat array". Recently Goblin's Henchman (Goblin) shared an [article on their blog](https://goblinshenchman.wordpress.com/2020/08/15/caterpillar-method-for-character-stat-generation/) about using different sides of the same dice to generate stats for characters in D&D.

This book shows that this method can be improved.

* [**Context**](../context) provides some context for those unfamiliar with D&D, and introduces the three stat generation methods.
* [**Individual Stats**](../individual-stats) shows how these three methods compare when looking at individual stats.
* [**Stat Arrays**](../arrays) shows how similar multiple characters will be when generated under each method.
* [**Alternative Methods**](../alternatives) considers some other methods of generating stats.

All of the code is available in the [Code](../code) chapter.

A small widget to let you roll your own stats is available in [Generate Your Own Stats](https://bradleytjandra.github.io/caterpillar-stat-generation/roll.html).
