Recently Goblin's Henchman (Goblin) shared an [article on their blog](https://goblinshenchman.wordpress.com/2020/08/15/caterpillar-method-for-character-stat-generation/) about using different sides of the same dice to generate stats for characters in D&D.

The suggested method sounds appealing to me because it purports to:

1. It allows players to have different stats. This makes it better than the standard array and (to some extent) point-buy.
2. It makes stats somewhat random, so that players can have more unique characters without needing to worry about whether they should be min-maxing. This makes it better than point-buy
3. Reduce the chances that players will have much better or worse stats than other players. This makes it better than 4d6-drop-lowest.
4. It generally produces higher numbers. This makes it better than the standard array (where the average score is 10.5) or 3d6.

These desiderata may not be important for you, but I felt they were sometimes issues enough that the potential for a different approach interests me.

I wanted to investigate how well it meets these three criteria, and whether we can do any better in our statistics. I focus mostly on the 4d6-drop-lowest ("4d6kh3") method, as that is my preferred method of stat generation.

All of the code used to generate these statistics can be seen here.
