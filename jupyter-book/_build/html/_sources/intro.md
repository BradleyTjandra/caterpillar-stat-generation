tl;dr
============================

Goblin's [caterpillar method](https://goblinshenchman.wordpress.com/2020/08/15/caterpillar-method-for-character-stat-generation/) of generating stats doesn't actually reduce the probability that some players will roll really good stats, and others will roll really low stats.

There is a better method. Follow Goblin's method as indicated, but instead of one stat being the sum of the *top* of the caterpillar, set one stat to be equal to the sum of the *bottom* (or "belly") of the caterpillar.

For example, to replicate the 4d6-drop-lowest:

* **Stat 1:** Add up the front face
* **Stat 2:** Add up the *bottom* face - this is the only change to Goblin's method.
* **Stat 3:** Add up the back 
* **Stat 4:** Add up all exposed faces on the left-most cube
* **Stat 5:** Add up all exposed faces on the right-most cube
* **Stat 6:** Add up all exposed faces on the centre cube. If the front face is a 4, 5 or 6, then also add the bottom face.
